From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms, and with powerful developer tools, ROS has what you need for your next robotics project. And it’s all open source.

Running `ros2 topic list -t`, one of the lines we get back is `/cmd_lightring [irobot_create_msgs/msg/LightringLeds]`. What this line means is that the **topic** is `/cmd_lightring`, and the type of **message** that are sent and recieved from that topic are `irobot_create_msgs/msg/LightringLeds`. Inspecting the code in [section 2](./02_Sending_Data.ipynb), the message type appears on line 6. \n",
